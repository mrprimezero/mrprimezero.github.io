<em>dnsmasq</em></p>

<p>Welcome back to the second installment of our cybersecurity home lab series! In our <a href="https://mrprimezero.github.io/posts/homelab_kalilinux/">previous post</a>, we established our attacker machine, Kali Linux, and prepared it for action. Now, we‚Äôre taking a critical step forward by building the perfect environment for it to operate in: a dedicated, isolated network.</p>

<p>Why is this so crucial? Because it allows us to simulate real-world scenarios without any risk to your home network. Instead of a messy, multi-VM configuration, we‚Äôll create a single, centralized server to handle all of our networking needs. In this guide, we‚Äôll leverage the lightweight and secure Alpine Linux to serve as our DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and DNS (Domain System Name) server, using the powerful <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dnsmasq</code> utility. This will give all our virtual machines their own private address space, just like in a real enterprise network.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Before we create our DHCP server we will have to download a light weight linux distribution which doesn‚Äôt take up much power so we can have it running while we run our other Virtual Machines, I have picked Alpine Linux since it has a command line interface and doesn‚Äôt take up much space and power. You may use any Linux distrobution that you desire.</p>

<h3 id="downloadables">Downloadables</h3>
<p>To get started you will need atleast 3GB free storage space and 512MB free RAM. Also you will have to download: <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Oracle VirtualBox</a> and you need to download Alpine Linux standard ISO <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/">here</a>, make sure to install the x86_64 version of the standard ISO.</p>

<h3 id="virtual-machine-creation">Virtual Machine creation</h3>
<p>Once you have downloaded everything go on to virtualbox and click on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code> to create a new virtual machine.

<em>New VM</em></p>

<p>Once you do that you will this screen, So now give your machine a name and select a location on a drive with atleast 3GB free space. THen click on ISO image and select your downloaded <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/">Alpine Linux Standard ISO</a>. Set the Type to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Linux</code>, Subtype to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Other Linux</code> and the version as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Other Linux (64 bit)</code>.

<em>Name and operating system</em></p>

<p>Now move to the Hardware section and select 512MB base memory and 1 CPU processor.

<em>VM Hardware</em></p>

<p>Now move on to the Hard disk section and select ‚ÄúCreate a Virtual Hard Disk Now‚Äù and give it atleast 2GB storage space. Now once everything is done click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Finish</code>.

<em>VM Storage</em></p>

<h3 id="os-installation">OS Installation</h3>
<p>Once the VM creation is done click on start and boot into Alpine Linux. Once in you should login as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root</code> so just type as root in the terminal and you will log in, there will not be any password and you can log in. If there is any issue make sure you have downloaded the correct ISO file and followed the VM creation steps properly.

<em>Root</em></p>

<p>Once you are logged in you must install the OS. To do so type this in the terminal.</p>
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><!-- <td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
</pre></td> --><td class="rouge-code"><pre><span class="go">setup-alpine
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/homelab/dnsmasq_dhcp/6.png" alt="Alpine setup" />
<em>Alpine setup</em></p>

<p>Once the setup launches select your preferred keymap and hit enter.

<em>Alpine keymap</em></p>

<p>After selecting the keymap you will be asked to enter a hostname, Give a hostname you prefer and hit enter.

<em>Alpine hostname</em></p>

<p>After you have given the hostname you will prompted to initialize an interface, the defualt would be eth0 so hit enter on that [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Important note: If you have added more than 1 adapter when creating the virtual machine, disable it. There will be problems with the installation</code>]. Then you will be asked to provide ip address for eth0, the default is dhcp so again hit enter. Once that is done you will be prompted to do any manual network configuration, again go with the defualt which is no or n.

<em>Alpine interface</em></p>

<p>Once the Interface setup is complete you will be asked to create a new password for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root</code> so give it a super secure super long password like I have. Also make sure you can remember the password.

<em>Alpine root password</em></p>

<p>Once that is done, select your preferred timezone and hit enter.

<em>Alpine timezone</em></p>

<p>After that you will be prompted for HTTP/FTP proxy, for now leave it as none and hit enter.
<img src="/assets/img/posts/homelab/dnsmasq_dhcp/12.png" alt="Alpine proxy" />
<em>Alpine proxy</em></p>

<p>Now you will be prompted to select a Network Time Protocol, you may select any that you prefer but I have chosen chrony.
<img src="/assets/img/posts/homelab/dnsmasq_dhcp/13.png" alt="Alpine NTP" />
<em>Alpine NTP</em></p>

<p>After you select your NTP client you will be asked to chose an APK Mirror, select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r</code> to use a random Mirror and hit enter.

<em>Alpine APK Mirror</em></p>

<p>After that step is complete you will be prompted to create a new user, select your preferred username and password and proceed. For the SSH key keep it as default which is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">none</code> and hit enter, then you are asked which SSH server to use leave it as default which is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openssh</code> and hit enter.
