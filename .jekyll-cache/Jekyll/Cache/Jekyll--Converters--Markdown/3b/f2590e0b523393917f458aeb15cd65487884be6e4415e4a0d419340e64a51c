I"'<p>Greetings, fellow digital denizens! I’m PrimeZero, a professional script kiddie (just kidding… mostly). I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast who’s passionate about poking and prodding at systems until they reveal their deepest, darkest secrets.</p>

<p>In my spare time (which is basically all the time), I can be found lurking in the shadows of platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox. Here, I hone my skills in the noble art of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Penetration Testing:</strong> I break stuff on purpose, uncovering vulnerabilities so I can patch them up (and maybe have a little fun along the way).</li>
  <li><strong>Vulnerability Assessment &amp; Exploitation:</strong> Basically, I try to break things on purpose (for educational purposes, of course!).</li>
  <li><strong>Network Security:</strong> I decipher the mysterious whispers of network protocols and learn how to keep the bad guys (basically me) out.</li>
  <li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> I dabble in the arcane arts of encryption and decryption, trying to outsmart those pesky algorithms.</li>
  <li><strong>Web Application Security:</strong> I hunt for vulnerabilities in websites, hoping to prevent the internet from imploding. (enter dramatic blast sound)</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m always learning and growing, because the world of cybersecurity is a never ending game of cat and mouse. I love sharing my knowledge and experiences with the community, and I hope to contribute to a more secure digital world… even if it means occasionally causing a little controlled (most of the time) chaos.</p>
